        <h1>Donkeys bray because they have something to say - Cliff Donkeys is ever-inpsired by places that are in the thick of managing overtourism.  Nothing wrong with a little Hee Haw.</h1>

        <h2>Soul connection with Santorini Donkeys</h2>
    
        <p>As a human being in their late forties who hadn't ridden a horse until her early 30s, I never thought I could relate to donkeys.</p>
        <p>On a recent trip to Santorini Greece, I disembarked a 4500 passenger floating hotel and was tendered over to Santorini in batches like holiday cookies to a double wall oven.</p>
        <p>Once on land, my eyes quickly glued over to the donkeys outlining an intimidating mountainous stone staircase.</p>
        <p>My knees began to ache sympathically imagining a climb up those stairs with a human being sitting on my back.</p>
        <p>Then my heart broke within seconds with the thought of having to climb those stairs with thousands of tourists on my back.</p>
        <p>I spoke with each donkey I could make eye contact, asking each donkey how they were doing? Were they well rested and ready to take what was washed ashore.</p>
        <p>A massive influx of tourists docked for less than 8 hours.  Most opting to ride a donkey up 600 steps rather than cable car or walk.  I can relate.</p>
    
        <p>I donâ€™t know what will be washed ashore in my life either.  We all can relate, support the community of Santorini so locaks and donkeys will be happier and healthier for future generations to visit.</p>
    
        <h2>Mindful in Mykonos</h2>
    
        <p>Salty air, clear blue waters that resemble emeralds worn by the first generations of mermaids that ever existed.</p>
        <p>Kitties adorably napping under the shade of beautiful mature trees while breezes from the Aegean Sea gentlty brush through their furry coats.</p>
        <p>Tourist toting styrofoam boxes of local leftovers innoncently eager to feed the kitten strays that along the coastline.</p>
        <p>Several tourists and locals alike unknowningly popping open their white treasure trove foods ready to pinch off a tiny bit.</p> 
        <p>Through the sea winds, steady flow of voices saying I think this is okay to feed kittens, don't you? Many didn't wait to an answer to their question just proceeded to feed.</p>
        <p>I can't, better yet, shouldn't eat many foods because I'll pay the price for it. Given our world full of dietary restrictions and reactions to foods I fit right in.</p>

        <p>Animals are sensitive to ceratin foods too; even on vacation.  Before feeding strays just think about the last time you ate something that made your tummy turbulent.</p>
    
        <h2>Meltdown in Messina</h2>
    
        <p>Sitting at a cozy little cafe in Messina I overheard a tourist complaining to the server about the size of their soda cans.  This lady was having an all out meltdown over a mini can.</p>
        <p>The soda cans were petit and slim in stature but the tourist's expectations were large and wide in demand.</p>
        <p>The cafe was the size of a New York step in and around kitchen for two.  Room for patron tables and chairs in the interior was void so the owner opted to place a few bistro sets on the side walk out front.</p>
        <p>The server puzzled by the interaction as was I.</p>
        <p>Nothing in the cafe was large in size, not its space or employees, I could easily see.</p>

        <p>Size does matter; both ways. Many communities source products that fit not only their budgets but their space.</p>
