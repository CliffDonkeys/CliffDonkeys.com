        <h1>Donkeys bray because they have something to say - Cliff Donkeys is ever-inpsired by places that are in the thick of managing overtourism.  Nothing wrong with a little Hee Haw.</h1>

        <h2>Santorini soul connection with donkeys</h2>
    
        <p>As a black woman in her late forties who hadn't ridden a horse until her early 30s, I never thought I could relate to donkeys.</p>
        <p>On a recent trip to Santorini Greece, I disembarked a 4500 passenger floating hotel and was tendered over to Santorini in batches like holiday cookies to a double wall oven.</p>
        <p>Once on land, my eyes quickly glued over to the donkeys outlining an intimidating mountainous stone staircase.</p>
        <p>My knees began to ache sympathically imagining a climb up those stairs with a human being sitting on my back.</p>
        <p>Then my heart broke within seconds with the thought of having to climb those stairs with thousands of tourists on my back.</p>
        <p>I spoke with each donkey I could make eye contact, asking each donkey how they were doing? Were they well rested and ready to take what was washed ashore.</p>
        <p>A massive influx of tourists docked for less than 8 hours.  Most opting to ride a donkey up 600 steps rather than cable car or walk.  I can relate.</p>
    
        <p>I donâ€™t know what will be washed ashore in my life either.  We all can relate, support the community of Santorini so locaks and donkeys will be happier and healthier for future generations to visit.</p>
    
        <h2>Be mindful in Mykonos</h2>
    
        <p>Salty air, clear blue waters that resemble emeralds worn by the first generations of mermaids that ever existed.</p>
        <p>Kitties under the shade of beautiful Greek trees.  Napping adorably and while awake curious.</p>
        <p>Tourist toting local food leftovers eager to feed the strays although it's the wrong way to feed a kitten.</p>
        <p>Kittens should be able to eat; fill in the blank and another feline life is at steak.</p>
