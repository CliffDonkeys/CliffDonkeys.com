    <p>Creative solutions to educate and spread awareness about the impact of tourism on local communities.</p>

    <p>As a black woman in her late forties, I never thought I’d relate to cliff donkeys.  On a recent trip to Santorini Greece, I disembarked a 4500 passenger floating hotel and like cookies we were tendered over to Santorini.  Once on land, my eyes glued over to the donkeys outlining an intimidating stone staircase with hella Olympic gold vertical.  I spoke with each donkey I could make eye contact, asking each donkey how they were doing? Were they well rested and ready to take what was washed ashore.  A massive influx of tourists docked for less than 8 hours.  Most opting to ride a donkey up 600 steps rather than cable car or walk.  I can relate. In my work life, constant uncertainty causing chaos cascading to me.  Like those donkeys, I don’t green light the loads that  I am assigned to carry.  I don’t know what will be washed ashore in my life either but I’ve got to figure out how to carry it.  </p>
