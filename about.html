    <h1>About the author</h1>
    <p>Creative solutions to educate and spread awareness about the impact of tourism on local communities.</p>

    <p>As a black woman in her late forties, I never thought I could relate to cliff donkeys.  On a recent trip to Santorini Greece, I disembarked a 4500 passenger floating hotel and like cookies we were tendered over to Santorini.  </p>

    <p>Once on land, my eyes glued over to the donkeys outlining an intimidating stone staircase with hella Olympic gold vertical.  I spoke with each donkey I could make eye contact, asking each donkey how they were doing? Were they well rested and ready to take what was washed ashore.  A massive influx of tourists docked for less than 8 hours.  Most opting to ride a donkey up 600 steps rather than cable car or walk.  I can relate. </p>

    <p>In my work life, constant uncertainty causing chaos cascading to me.  Like those donkeys, I don’t green light the loads that  I am assigned to carry.  I don’t know what will be washed ashore in my life either but I’ve got to figure out how to carry it.  </p>
